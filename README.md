### Hi Folks 👋 
My name is Yueyang Pan. Currently I am pursuing my PhD at EPFL about computer systems and machine learning systems. I have faith in AGI, and I am actively embracing LLM to be integrated into my daily workflow. 
I like to learn how to harness AI power and build product which is infeasible for a single person in the previous era.
I also like to contribute to open source projects as I believe open source is the best way to amortize the infra cost. 
My personal website is https://panjason.github.io/. Have a look at it.
