### Hi folks 👋
I’m Yueyang Pan — a PhD researcher at EPFL working at the intersection of
computer systems and machine learning systems. I work in a full-stack way by
building infrastructure and products that turn ideas into reality.

#### What I care about 🔭 
- **AGI and LLM-native workflows**: I’m exploring how LLM-powered Agents can be woven into everyday engineering to amplify the productivity of an individual.
- **Personalized agents**: Agents should be equipped with low-cost, personalized memory like J.A.R.V.I.S.
- **Robust scalable systems**: I love turning prototyping and research into robust, reusable platforms.
- **Open source**: The best way to amortize infrastructure costs and accelerate progress.
